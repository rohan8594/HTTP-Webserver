### Overview

The goal of this project is to design and develop a multi-threaded web server capable of a subset of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The final developed server can parse HTTP requests (like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE), authenticate them, load mime types, create and send appropriate responses, run CGI scripts and handle multiple requests at a time.


### Instructions to Compile

From your terminal:

```
$ javac WebServer.java
$ java WebServer
```
